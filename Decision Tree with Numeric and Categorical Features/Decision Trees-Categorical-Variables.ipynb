    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this part of assigment is to implement a Decision Tree Classifier for categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** Please note that you are allowed to use only those libraries which we have discussed in the class, i.e. numpy, scipy, pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "You are required to submit the original notebook file on the Slate (with .ipynb extension), with complete set of outputs. Students failing to do so will get zero marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Please read each step carefully and understand it fully before proceeding with code writing*\n",

    "### Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in this assignment we will be implementing the Decision Classifier for both Continuous and Categorical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree can be built by using any of the following split criterias, namely:\n",
    " - Information Gain\n",
    " - Gini Index\n",
    " - CART \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you are required here to implement the decision tree with information gain as splitting criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember in my code i am not looking for maximizing the information gain, instead i am looking for minimizing the split entropy. Recall,\n",
    "$$Information Gain  = H(D) - H(D_Y,D_N)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "\n",
    "$H(D)$ is the data set entroy and $H(D_Y,D_N)$ is split entropy. Since $H(D)$ is constant for the given dataset so maximizing the entropy is equal to minimizing the split entropy and that is what is being represented in my code outputs."

    "This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525).  Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended.  This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.  The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.\n",
